This is a playground to learn threejs + XR.

It's a mashup of own code, some three js examples, some code from [xr-locomotion-start](https://github.com/SamsungInternet/xr-locomotion-starter) and some other snippets.


To use it:

- Install threejs in the project folder: `npm install three`
- Start up a https server to serve index.html. You can use `http-server.py`
