This is a playground to learn threejs + XR.

It's a mashup of own code, some three js examples, some code from [xr-locomotion-start](https://github.com/SamsungInternet/xr-locomotion-starter), the ui is done with [three-mesh-ui](https://github.com/felixmariotto/three-mesh-ui) and there are some other snippets around.

It was tested with a Quest 2.

To use it:

- Install dependencies: `npm install`
- Start up a https server to serve index.html. You can use `http-server.py`
